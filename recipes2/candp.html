    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>½ cup dry white wine, see notes</li>

    <li>3/4 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups half and half</li>

    <li>½ lb. Penne</li>

    <li>½ teaspoon mustard powder</li>
    <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, optional</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prep Work: Combine the seasoning ingredients and set aside. I recommend that you measure out the remaining ingredients as well, the recipe will be a breeze from there!</li>
    <li>Cut the chicken into ¾-inch pieces and season it in Lemon Pepper Seasoning. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook on each side for 2-3 minutes, until a brown crust has developed. Remove and set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted pasta water to a boil while you begin to prepare the sauce as outlined below.</li>
    <li>Add the white wine to the same pot that you used to cook the chicken and set the heat to medium. Use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom of the pot. Let it reduce by half, about 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the butter and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
    <li>Add chicken broth in small splashes, stirring continuously. Add the half and half in the same manner, then add the hot sauce and seasonings. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cover it partially.</li>
    <li>Boil the pasta to al dente according to package instructions. Add the broccoli to the boiling pasta water during the last 4 minutes, then drain.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat of sauce to low and slowly stir in the grated cheese.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Add the pasta, broccoli, and the chicken and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt if desired. Serve!</li>
